  <p><b>Patient Querer</b> is a challenge question at McHacks 12 where we wanted to make a user interface that would help make patients that are waiting for their appointment feel better.</p>
  <p>Here was a list of things that we have planned to make:</p>
  <ul>API Search Box: Patients can look up their name in database that contains many patients. They will be able to retrieve their status, ID, time elapsed...etc.</ul>
  <ul>Graph: If we take all of past patients data and collect them, we can make a graph of estimation with respect to time. This will show how long the patient is supposed to wait for on average.</ul>
  <ul>Request button: For every 25min that patient has waited, the patient will able to press a request button that sends a alarm to the doctor they assigned.</ul>

  <p>The problem with the long waiting time is having no sense of whether you will called or not and when you will be called. Many of us, including myself have
  experienced super long waiting time (~5 hours) for small appointments. Sometimes it could be argent. This is very frustrating and time wasting. The best way is
  to have a visual GUI that shows how many people are in front them, how long is expected wait time and give them the right to make a quest every 25min of waitng.</p>
